A terminal-based game of hangman made using C++ on Ubuntu and WSL. The game plays as regular hangman with 
each guess of a letter either completing part of the word or of the graphic. Includes a line by line incremented graphic 
rather than a gradually draw image as in traditional version of the game as well as an intuitive display of remaining 
guesses, all guessed characters and the correct and blank characters. Check it out here on my [Git-Hub][github].
