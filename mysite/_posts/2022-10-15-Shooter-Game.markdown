A space based local 2 player shooter game with each player controlling their own ship to destroy their opponentâ€™s
ship. Developed in C++ and utilizes the SFML library for graphics rendering, Conan package manager for easy and 
efficient dependency management and to facilitate cross platform development. Check it out here on my [Git-Hub][github].
