Second year computer science student at the University of Adelaide.

I am an aspiring software engineer who loves mathematics, problem solving and applying thoery to real world problems with a particular intrigue in new and emerging technologies. My key areas of interest are game-development, low latency programming and algorithum design. I also want to explore other areas of computer science such as AI, cyber security and web-development.

When I am not working hard to solve problems within a project I enjoy relaxing by going on hikes, to the beach, cycling, going the the gym, playing with the cat or just watching history or space documentaries. Along with these relaxing activities I enjoy participating in coding challenges/events as they are lower stress and still allow me to exercise my problem solving and critical thinking.

I am graduating in 2024 and currently looking for internship roles in software engineering to broaden my experience with technology, please feel free to get in touch.
